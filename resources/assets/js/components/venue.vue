                            <p class="tracking-wide">We picked the Hotel Preston for its location in Nashville. Less then a 10 minute drive to the airport, so no one has to go to far, yet right outside of the main downtown area.
                                It has been recently remodeled and we can not wait to show you. They have a convenient shuttle that runs downtown in case you want to explore the music and sights of Nashville, and you
                                are also minutes away from one of Nashville's most history sites: The Grand Ole Opry.
                            </p>
                            <p class="tracking-wide">Some of the things you can do while at the Hotel Preston:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="tracking-wide">24 hour gym</li>
                                <li class="tracking-wide">Listen to live music in their lounge</li>
                                <li class="tracking-wide">Be 20 minutes away from downtown and 10 minutes away from the airport</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="tracking-wide">In order to help our attendees out, we have got a nice little deal with the hotel to get a discount on a room! The best part about this code is that it does not expire. Use it today, tomorrow or the day before the conference (rooms permitting of course).</p>
                            <p class="tracking-wide">To book, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/SEPHPPreston"><button class="btn button-red">click here!</button></a> and use the code SOUTHEAST. This is good till the day of the conference, so take advantage of it!</p>
