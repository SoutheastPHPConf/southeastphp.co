        <p class="text-center">The Southeast PHP Conference was formed by the organizers of the Nashville PHP Meetup who wanted to provide a conference for PHP developers in the Southeastern United States and abroad. Currently, the Southeast does not host a regional PHP conference, even though there are lots of PHP developers. The Southeast PHP Conference was born to serve this community and to help connect it with the worldwide PHP community by giving regional developers a chance to connect with each other and the broader PHP community.</p>
        <p class="text-center">We plan on bringing the best speakers in the PHP Community and a few from the JS/Python community to give talks and tutorials in a wide variety of topics relevant to PHP and its ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="text-center">While you are here in Nashville, we hope you will take in the sights of our beloved city. We have compiled a list of things to check out in Nashville while you visit (and are still adding more)!</p>
        <p class="text-center">To read more about the organizers, check out the <a href="/about/">Organizers</a> page!</p>

                <p>We have picked the wonderful Hotel Preston as our venue this year. We picked it for a few reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Close to the airport</li>
                  <li>Low prices</li>
                  <li>Close to downtown</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We hope that you will use the venue as a place to learn, grow, and meet new people, and we hope that you can use the venue as a springboard to downtown and check out Nashville!</p>
